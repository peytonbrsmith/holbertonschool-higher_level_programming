The ``5-text_indentation`` module
============================

``text_indentation`` - prints a square of #s of size size
---------------------

This is the test file for 5-text_indentation.py.  First import
``text_indentation`` from the ``5-text_indentation`` module:

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation

Testing it with short sentence containing '?' , '.' , ':':
::
    >>> text_indentation("This is a test. It should work: Hopefully?")
    This is a test.
    <BLANKLINE>
    It should work:
    <BLANKLINE>
    Hopefully?
    <BLANKLINE>

Testing it with non-string:
::
    >>> text_indentation(4)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string
