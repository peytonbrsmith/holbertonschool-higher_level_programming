The ``2-matrix_divided`` module
============================

``matrix_divided`` - divides matrices of ints/floats by ints/floats
---------------------

This is the test file for 2-matrix_divided.py.  First import
``matrix_divided`` from the ``2-matrix_divided`` module:

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Testing it with single digit positive integers:
::
    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Testing it with non-list of list matrix:
::
    >>> matrix = 4
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Testing it with a list of lists of non-ints/floats:
::
    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, "Fork"]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Testing it with a list of non-lists:
::
    >>> matrix = [1, 2, "Fork"]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Testing it with row of incorrect size:
::
    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6, 4],
    ...     [1, 2, 3]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Testing it with an empty list:
::
    >>> matrix = []
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Testing it with a divisor of 0:
::
    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Testing it with a divisor of non-number:
::
    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 'c')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number

Testing it with one argument:
::
    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix_divided() missing 1 required positional argument: 'div'

Testing it with no arguments:
::
    >>> matrix_divided()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix_divided() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'matrix' and 'div'

Testing it with float('inf'):
::
    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, float('inf'))
    [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]
